Before the `time_remaining` period has elapsed, the destroyed resource can be recovered by setting `destroyed=false`. Once the `time_remaining` period has elapsed, the resource is permanently eradicated and can no longer be recovered.

If the suffix is not specified, the system constructs the snapshot name in the form `VOL.NNN`, where `VOL` is the volume name, and `NNN` is a monotonically increasing number.
