# **Api28ConnectionsGet**
> InlineResponse20041 Api28ConnectionsGet(ctx, optional)
List volume connections

Displays a list of connections between a volume and its hosts and host groups, and the logical unit numbers (LUNs) used by the associated hosts to address these volumes.

### Required Parameters

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **ctx** | **context.Context** | context for authentication, logging, cancellation, deadlines, tracing, etc.
 **optional** | ***ConnectionsApiApi28ConnectionsGetOpts** | optional parameters | nil if no parameters

### Optional Parameters
Optional parameters are passed through a pointer to a ConnectionsApiApi28ConnectionsGetOpts struct
Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **authorization** | **optional.String**| Access token (in JWT format) required to use any API endpoint (except &#x60;/oauth2&#x60;, &#x60;/login&#x60;, and &#x60;/logout&#x60;) | 
 **xRequestID** | **optional.String**| Supplied by client during request or generated by server. | 
 **continuationToken** | **optional.String**| A token used to retrieve the next page of data with some consistency guaranteed. The token is a Base64 encoded value. Set &#x60;continuation_token&#x60; to the system-generated token taken from the &#x60;x-next-token&#x60; header field of the response. A query has reached its last page when the response does not include a token. Pagination requires the &#x60;limit&#x60; and &#x60;continuation_token&#x60; query parameters. | 
 **filter** | **optional.String**| Narrows down the results to only the response objects that satisfy the filter criteria. | 
 **hostGroupNames** | [**optional.Interface of []string**](string.md)| Performs the operation on the host group specified. Enter multiple names in comma-separated format. A request cannot include a mix of multiple objects with multiple names. For example, a request cannot include a mix of multiple host group names and volume names; instead, at least one of the objects (e.g., &#x60;host_group_names&#x60;) must be set to only one name (e.g., &#x60;hgroup01&#x60;). | 
 **hostNames** | [**optional.Interface of []string**](string.md)| Performs the operation on the hosts specified. Enter multiple names in comma-separated format. For example, &#x60;host01,host02&#x60;. A request cannot include a mix of multiple objects with multiple names. For example, a request cannot include a mix of multiple host names and volume names; instead, at least one of the objects (e.g., &#x60;host_names&#x60;) must be set to only one name (e.g., &#x60;host01&#x60;). | 
 **limit** | **optional.Int32**| Limits the size of the response to the specified number of objects on each page. To return the total number of resources, set &#x60;limit&#x3D;0&#x60;. The total number of resources is returned as a &#x60;total_item_count&#x60; value. If the page size requested is larger than the system maximum limit, the server returns the maximum limit, disregarding the requested page size. | 
 **offset** | **optional.Int32**| The starting position based on the results of the query in relation to the full set of response objects returned. | 
 **protocolEndpointNames** | [**optional.Interface of []string**](string.md)| Performs the operation on the protocol endpoints specified. Enter multiple names in comma-separated format. For example, &#x60;pe01,pe02&#x60;. A request cannot include a mix of multiple objects with multiple names. For example, a request cannot include a mix of multiple protocol endpoint names and host names; instead, at least one of the objects (e.g., &#x60;protocol_endpoint_names&#x60;) must be set to one name (e.g., &#x60;pe01&#x60;). | 
 **sort** | [**optional.Interface of []string**](string.md)| Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set &#x60;sort&#x60; to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (&#x60;-&#x60;) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names as comma-separated values. | 
 **totalItemCount** | **optional.Bool**| If set to &#x60;true&#x60;, the &#x60;total_item_count&#x60; matching the specified query parameters is calculated and returned in the response. If set to &#x60;false&#x60;, the &#x60;total_item_count&#x60; is &#x60;null&#x60; in the response. This may speed up queries where the &#x60;total_item_count&#x60; is large. If not specified, defaults to &#x60;false&#x60;. | 
 **volumeNames** | [**optional.Interface of []string**](string.md)| Performs the operation on the volume specified. Enter multiple names in comma-separated format. For example, &#x60;vol01,vol02&#x60;. A request cannot include a mix of multiple objects with multiple names. For example, a request cannot include a mix of multiple volume names and host names; instead, at least one of the objects (e.g., &#x60;volume_names&#x60;) must be set to only one name (e.g., &#x60;vol01&#x60;). |
