type DirectorySnapshot struct {
	// A globally unique, system-generated ID. The ID cannot be modified and cannot refer to another resource.
	Id string `json:"id,omitempty"`
	// A user-specified name. The name must be locally unique and can be changed.
	Name string `json:"name,omitempty"`
	// The customizable portion of the client visible snapshot name. A full snapshot name is constructed in the form of `DIR.CLIENT_NAME.SUFFIX` where `DIR` is the full managed directory name, `CLIENT_NAME` is the client name, and `SUFFIX` is the suffix. The client visible snapshot name is `CLIENT_NAME.SUFFIX`.
	ClientName string `json:"client_name,omitempty"`
	// The snapshot creation time, measured in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch.
	Created int64 `json:"created,omitempty"`
	// Returns a value of `true` if the snapshot has been destroyed and is pending eradication. The `time_remaining` value displays the amount of time left until the destroyed directory snapshot is permanently eradicated. Before the `time_remaining` period has elapsed, the destroyed directory snapshot can be recovered by setting `destroyed=false`. Once the `time_remaining` period has elapsed, the directory snapshot is permanently eradicated and can no longer be recovered.
	Destroyed bool `json:"destroyed,omitempty"`
	Policy *DirectorySnapshotPolicy `json:"policy,omitempty"`
	Source *DirectorySnapshotSource `json:"source,omitempty"`
	Space *DirectorySpaceSpace `json:"space,omitempty"`
	// The suffix that is appended to the `source_name` value and the `client_name` value to generate the full directory snapshot name in the form of `DIR.CLIENT_NAME.SUFFIX` where `DIR` is the managed directory name, `CLIENT_NAME` is the client name, and `SUFFIX` is the suffix. If the suffix is a string, this field returns `null`. See the `name` value for the full snapshot name including the suffix.
	Suffix int64 `json:"suffix,omitempty"`
	// The amount of time left until the directory snapshot is permanently eradicated. Measured in milliseconds. Before the `time_remaining` period has elapsed, the snapshot can be recovered by setting `destroyed=false` if it is destroyed, by setting `policy=\"\"` if it is managed by a snapshot policy, or by setting `keep_for=\"\"` if it is a manual snapshot.
	TimeRemaining int64 `json:"time_remaining,omitempty"`
