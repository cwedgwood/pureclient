Delete pod replica links

Deletes pod replica links. The `local_pod_names` and `remote_pod_names` are required. Valid values are `replicating`, `baselining`, `paused`, `unhealthy`, `quiescing`, and `quiesced`. A status of `replicating` indicates that the source array is replicating to the target array. A status of `baselining` indicates that the the initial version of the dataset is being sent. During this phase, you cannot promote the target pod. In addition, changing the link direction might trigger the `baselining` status to recur. A status of `paused ` indicates that data transfer between objects has stopped. A status of `unhealthy` indicates that the link is currently unhealthy and customers must perform some health checks to determine the cause. A status of `quiescing` indicates that the source pod is not accepting new write requests but the most recent changes to the source have not arrived on the target. A status of `quiesced` indicates that the source pod has been demoted and all changes have been replicated to the target pod.

To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (&#x60;-&#x60;) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects.

The &#x60;start_time&#x60; and &#x60;end_time&#x60; parameters are specified in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch. If &#x60;start_time&#x60; is not specified, the start time will default to one resolution before the end time, meaning that the most recent sample of performance data will be displayed. If &#x60;end_time&#x60;is not specified, the end time will default to the current time. Include the &#x60;resolution&#x60; parameter to display the performance data at the specified resolution. If not specified, &#x60;resolution&#x60; defaults to the lowest valid resolution. | 
 **ids** | [**optional.Interface of []string**](string.md)| Performs the operation on the unique resource IDs specified. Enter multiple resource IDs in comma-separated format. The &#x60;ids&#x60; and &#x60;names&#x60; parameters cannot be provided together. | 
 **limit** | **optional.Int32**| Limits the size of the response to the specified number of objects on each page. To return the total number of resources, set &#x60;limit&#x3D;0&#x60;. The total number of resources is returned as a &#x60;total_item_count&#x60; value. If the page size requested is larger than the system maximum limit, the server returns the maximum limit, disregarding the requested page size. | 
 **localPodIds** | [**optional.Interface of []string**](string.md)| A comma-separated list of local pod IDs. If, after filtering, there is not at least one resource that matches each of the elements, then an error is returned. This cannot be provided together with the &#x60;local_pod_names&#x60; query parameter. | 
 **localPodNames** | [**optional.Interface of []string**](string.md)| A comma-separated list of local pod names. If, after filtering, there is not at least one resource that matches each of the elements, then an error is returned. This cannot be provided together with the &#x60;local_pod_ids&#x60; query parameter. | 
 **offset** | **optional.Int32**| The starting position based on the results of the query in relation to the full set of response objects returned. | 
 **remoteIds** | [**optional.Interface of []string**](string.md)| A comma-separated list of remote array IDs. If, after filtering, there is not at least one resource that matches each of the elements, then an error is returned. This cannot be provided together with the &#x60;remote_names&#x60; query parameter. | 
 **remoteNames** | [**optional.Interface of []string**](string.md)| A comma-separated list of remote array names. If, after filtering, there is not at least one resource that matches each of the elements, then an error is returned. This cannot be provided together with the &#x60;remote_ids&#x60; query parameter. | 
 **remotePodIds** | [**optional.Interface of []string**](string.md)| A comma-separated list of remote pod IDs. If, after filtering, there is not at least one resource that matches each of the elements, then an error is returned. This cannot be provided together with the &#x60;remote_pod_names&#x60; query parameter. | 
 **remotePodNames** | [**optional.Interface of []string**](string.md)| A comma-separated list of remote pod names. If, after filtering, there is not at least one resource that matches each of the elements, then an error is returned. This cannot be provided together with the &#x60;remote_pod_ids&#x60; query parameter. | 
 **sort** | [**optional.Interface of []string**](string.md)| Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set &#x60;sort&#x60; to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (&#x60;-&#x60;) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names as comma-separated values. | 
 **totalItemCount** | **optional.Bool**| If set to &#x60;true&#x60;, the &#x60;total_item_count&#x60; matching the specified query parameters is calculated and returned in the response. If set to &#x60;false&#x60;, the &#x60;total_item_count&#x60; is &#x60;null&#x60; in the response. This may speed up queries where the &#x60;total_item_count&#x60; is large. If not specified, defaults to &#x60;false&#x60;. | 
 **totalOnly** | **optional.Bool**| If set to &#x60;true&#x60;, only return the aggregate value of all items after filtering. For real-time performance, the values are aggregated for the latest timestamp. For historical performance, the values are aggregated for each timestamp from &#x60;start_time&#x60; to &#x60;end_time&#x60;. Where it makes more sense, the average value is displayed instead. The values are displayed for each name where meaningful. If &#x60;total_only&#x3D;true&#x60;, the &#x60;items&#x60; list will be empty. |

# **Api28PodReplicaLinksPost**
> InlineResponse200100 Api28PodReplicaLinksPost(ctx, optional)
Create pod replica links

Creates pod replica links between two arrays. The `local_pod_names` and `remote_pod_names` are required. Valid values are `replicating`, `baselining`, `paused`, `unhealthy`, `quiescing`, and `quiesced`. A status of `replicating` indicates that the source array is replicating to the target array. A status of `baselining` indicates that the the initial version of the dataset is being sent. During this phase, you cannot promote the target pod. In addition, changing the link direction might trigger the `baselining` status to recur. A status of `paused ` indicates that data transfer between objects has stopped. A status of `unhealthy` indicates that the link is currently unhealthy and customers must perform some health checks to determine the cause. A status of `quiescing` indicates that the source pod is not accepting new write requests but the most recent changes to the source have not arrived on the target. A status of `quiesced` indicates that the source pod has been demoted and all changes have been replicated to the target pod.
