// A protocol endpoint (also known as a conglomerate volume) which acts as a proxy through which virtual volumes are created and then connected to VMware ESXi hosts or host groups. The protocol endpoint itself does not serve I/Os; instead, its job is to form connections between FlashArray volumes and ESXi hosts and host groups.
type Api28connectionsProtocolEndpoint struct {
	// A globally unique, system-generated ID. The ID cannot be modified.
	Id string `json:"id,omitempty"`
	// The resource name, such as volume name, pod name, snapshot name, and so on.
	Name string `json:"name,omitempty"`
