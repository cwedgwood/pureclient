	// The logical unit number (LUN) by which the specified hosts are to address the specified volume. If the LUN is not specified, the system automatically assigns a LUN to the connection. To automatically assign a LUN to a private connection, the system starts at LUN `1` and counts up to the maximum LUN `4095`, assigning the first available LUN to the connection. For shared connections, the system starts at LUN `254` and counts down to the minimum LUN `1`, assigning the first available LUN to the connection. If all LUNs in the `[1...254]` range are taken, the system starts at LUN `255` and counts up to the maximum LUN `4095`, assigning the first available LUN to the connection.
