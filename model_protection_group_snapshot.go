	// Returns a value of `true` if the protection group snapshot has been destroyed and is pending eradication. The `time_remaining` value displays the amount of time left until the destroyed snapshot is permanently eradicated. Before the `time_remaining` period has elapsed, the destroyed snapshot can be recovered by setting `destroyed=false`. Once the `time_remaining` period has elapsed, the snapshot is permanently eradicated and can no longer be recovered.

If `suffix` is not specified, the protection group name is in the form `PGROUP.NNN`, where `NNN` is a unique monotonically increasing number. If multiple protection group snapshots are created at a time, the suffix name is appended to those snapshots.
	Suffix string `json:"suffix,omitempty"`
